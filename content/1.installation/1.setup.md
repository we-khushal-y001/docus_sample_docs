# Set up an editor

You can build apps with Flutter using any text editor combined with Flutter’s command-line tools. However, we recommend using one of our editor plugins for an even better experience. These plugins provide you with code completion, syntax highlighting, widget editing assists, run & debug support, and more. :br
Use the following steps to add an editor plugin for VS Code, Android Studio, IntelliJ, or Emacs. If you want to use a different editor, that’s OK, skip ahead to the next step: Test drive.

## Install VS Code

VS Code is a lightweight editor with complete Flutter app execution and debug support.

- VS Code, latest stable version

## Install the Flutter and Dart plugins

1. Start VS Code.
2. Invoke **View > Command Palette….**
3. Type “install”, and select **Extensions: Install Extensions.**
4. Type “flutter” in the extensions search field, select **Flutter** in the list, and click **Install**. This also installs the required Dart plugin.

## Validate your setup with the Flutter Doctor

1. Invoke **View > Command Palette….**
2. Type “doctor”, and select the **Flutter: Run Flutter Doctor.**
3. Review the output in the **OUTPUT** pane for any issues. Make sure to select Flutter from the dropdown in the different Output Options.
